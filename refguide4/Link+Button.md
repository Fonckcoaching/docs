Pressing a link button can trigger a variety of actions, some of which are specific to mobile devices.

## General Properties

### Link Type

This specifies the type of action triggered when pressing the button. The options are:

*   Navigating to a url.
*   Composing an e-mail.
*   Sending a text message.
*   Starting a call.

### Address

The address property is used differently depending on the chosen link type. It is used either as a url, as an e-mail address, or as a phone number.
The address can be set to either a literal value, or an attribute value. An attribute address specifies a path to an attribute. The path starts at the entity of the dataview in which the link button is contained.
