A check box shows a box that is either ticked or empty. You can use it to display and/or edit a truth value.

<div class="alert alert-info">{% markdown %}

This check box allows the end-user to choose whether to send an e-mail or not.

{% endmarkdown %}</div>

A check box must be placed in a table cell within a data view, or within a template grid, and must be connected to an attribute of type Boolean. The connected attribute is shown in blue, and between brackets, behind the check box. At run-time, a ticked check box corresponds to true and an empty check box to false.
