## Description

## Instructions

![](attachments/819203/917932.png) **Open the enumeration by double-clicking on it in the Project Explorer.**

The caption is the text that will be displayed in the application, whereas the name is the property by which the enumeration value is identified by the client. Finally you can add a picture for the enumeration value, which can be used for display in data grids.**

![](attachments/819203/917932.png) **Press the 'Edit' button while highlighting the caption that needs to be changed, or double-click on it. In the edit menu that appears, you can now replace the caption from the default language with a translated caption in the new language.**
