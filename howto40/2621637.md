## Create your new How To's in this section

Please create your new How To's as child of this page. As this How To space does not have a content moderation system where articles are eventually set to 'Published', any new page you create will be instantly visible to every person viewing the How To's.

This section however is restricted to viewing by Mendix personnel only. As a result, you can work here together on new articles, and articles which contain relevant information but are not ready for publishing yet can be consulted by other folks from Mendix.

When your articles are ready for publishing, you can then move them to the other areas of this space. Please make sure to keep your How To pages in the template used by the existing articles, so we can keep a consistent look and feel for this How To space!
