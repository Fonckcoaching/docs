## Create new articles in "How To's under development"

This space does not have a content moderation system with articles only becoming visible to the public once they are set to 'Published'. As a result, any article you create would be immediately visible for any user. Since these articles will generally not be in a state fit for publishing yet, this is obviously not desirable.

To work around this, there is the [How To's under development](https://world.mendix.com/display/howto25/How+To%27s+under+development) section. Viewing this page (and as a result its children) is restricted to Mendix personnel only. As a result it's still possible to work with several people on a new How To, and articles which contain relevant information but are not ready for publishing yet can be consulted internally.

## Give your How To the same structure as existing articles

To make sure this How To space keeps a consistent feel and experience for readers, please make sure to follow the structure of the existing articles. There are no fixed templates such as in the 2.4 space. Headers are just simply created using wiki markup commands. If you start from scratch and have an empty article, you can copy-paste the following code in wiki markup to create the basic framework for the article:

```
{anchor:Back to the top}
h1\. How To: <Insert title>

h2\. Description

This section describes <content>. The related reference guide article can be found [here|link].

h2\. Instructions

!ATT:Attachment Store^BlueLinkArrow.png!

[!ATT:Attachment Store^up_arrow_small.png!|#Back to the top][(Back to Top)|#Back to the top]
```

Once this is interpreted by wiki markup, this gives the following result:

## Description

This section describes <content>. The related reference guide article can be found .

## Instructions

![](attachments/819203/917932.png)

[![](attachments/819203/917564.png)](2621638)[(Back to Top)](2621638)

You still get to fill in the following things:

*   Fill in the title of your article at
    ```
    <Insert title>
    ```

*   Fill in a short description of the contents of the How To at
    ```
    <content>
    ```

*   Copy-paste the link to the related reference guide article if one exists at
    ```
    [here|link]
    ```
    If not, or if there is another documentation area you want to point to, change this sentence accordingly.

Additionally, the first and last lines of the code will create an anchor with a 'Back to the top' link at the bottom of the page, whereas

```
!ATT:Attachment Store^BlueLinkArrow.png!
```

is the code to add the horizontal blue arrow icon which is used in most of the How To's to indicate new points.

## Link the relevant articles

*   In the Description section, link back to the related reference guide article. (Or a tutorial page for example, if there is no reference guide article)
*   Link to the How To from the article you linked to in the previous step. For example link from the article in the reference guide to the How To. If there is a 'Related Articles' section at the bottom of the screen, add the link there with the full title of the article (including 'How to:'). If not, add a section 'Related Articles' with h2\. header at the bottom of the page, and add the link there with a bullet point. For example

```
h2\. Related Articles
* [How To: Create a specialized entity|https://world.mendix.com/display/howto25/Create+a+specialized+entity]

```

Which results in:

## Related Articles

*   [How To: Create a specialized entity](https://world.mendix.com/display/howto25/Create+a+specialized+entity)

## Don't make your pictures too big

If your picture is so wide that you have to horizontally scroll on your 24" screen, you can safely assume the picture is too big. Generally do not make pictures wider than 1024 pixels. You can easily add this resizing option in the picture link:

```
!picture.png|width=1024!
```

Where picture.png is the name of your picture.

## Give articles that should show up in the index a label

Pages which act as parents to others and do not hold anything particularly interesting themselves should obviously not show up in the index. However, actual articles should be showing up. To do this, add a label to the article. The index has all articles broken down according to topic; give your article the label you consider the most fitting. After this the article will be listed under this topic.

If none of the existing labels fit (such as for example for the SAP integration, which should be a separate topic), create a new label . This new topic will also have to be added to the index page. If you are fairly familiar with Confluence, looking at the code should make it fairly easy to create a new topic with associated articles. If not, have someone who does know do this, or just contact Sjoerd on Jabber.

Make sure the new label does not already exist for use in other spaces. The index will list pages with that label from the entire confluence, so if the label is already in use, this will include pages from other spaces, which is not intended. In this case, you could avoid this by adding 'howto' to the label.

List of labels currently in use for the How To 2.5 space:

*   customwidgets
*   documents
*   domainmodel
*   forms
*   howtodeployment
*   howtointernationalization
*   howtosecurity
*   integration
*   java
*   microflows
*   projectsettings
*   performance
