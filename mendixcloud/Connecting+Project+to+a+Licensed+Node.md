*   How to unlink (delete) your sandbox.
*   How to connect a project to a licensed node.

## 1. Preparation

Before you can start with this how-to, please make sure you have completed the following prerequisites.

*   A project that has been connected to a sandbox/free app.
*   Sandbox/free app (Each team server project has a sandbox/ free app attached (Mendix version 5.18 and up).
*   Have a licensed node available.

## 2\. Downloading a backup

Because we are going to unlink the sandbox/free app from the project, the sandbox/free app will be deleted. That is why all data will be lost from the sandbox/free app or licensed node. To keep your data a backup needs to be created.

The documentation on how to download a backup can be found [here.](How+to+download+a+backup)

## 3\. Unlinking project from sandbox and connecting to a licensed node

When you have a project running in the sandbox/free app you will need to unlink the project from the sandbox/free app. Unlinking the project from the sandbox/free app will cause the sandbox/free app to be deleted.
